# RestAssuredAPI
Testing the lms API using RestAssured library
A Learning management system used to manage authorized staffs and students spread across multiple batches and programs.
A tool which can be used by educational institutions to host their curriculum and hub for online community. 
It provides provisions to view program information, record student attendance, create and grade assignments, post study resources and class recordings.

It has 2 parts :
An admin interface: The admin interface is where a training manager or performance coach can create, manage, and organize all the training material. 
Also, it is possible to extract insightful reports (individual or group based).

The user interface: The user interface is where a participant sees an experience what an admin created.

Automation Framework: In order to ensure the reliability and functionality of the Learning Management System (LMS) API, 
I systematically implemented and executed tests for CRUD operations using the RestAssured framework in conjunction with Cucumber (BDD).
